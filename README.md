# Model-based Meta-Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Human-Robot Collaboration

This repository contains the official implementation of the paper [Individualized Adaptive Robot Control Strategies for Cohesive Human-Robot Collaboration in Construction]().

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
    ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To run the project, execute the `model_based_rl.py` script. This script trains the Human Response Model and uses it to control a robot in a simulated environment. The robot's actions are guided by the predicted human responses to its state.
